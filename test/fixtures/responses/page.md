Page Title: What is HTML?

Alright, let's start at the very beginning. What exactly is HTML? HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard language for creating and structuring web pages. Essentially, it provides the building blocks for everything you see on a website.

Imagine a website as a house. HTML is like the foundation and structure of the house. It defines the layout of the rooms, the doors, and the windows. Just like a blueprint for a house, HTML outlines the structure and layout of a webpage.

HTML uses tags to define different elements on a web page. For example, the <p> tag is used to define paragraphs, the <a> tag for links, and the <img> tag for images. These tags are like the different components used in building a house, such as bricks, windows, and doors.

Now, let's have a quick interactive element:

## Multiple Choice
<div id="answerable-multiple-choice">
    <p id="question">Which of the following tags is used to define paragraphs in HTML?</p>
    <select id="choices">
        <option><p> tag</option>
        <option id="correct-answer"><P> tag</option>
        <option><paragraph> tag</option>
        <option><para> tag</option>
    </select>
</div>

Understanding HTML is the first step in building solid foundations for web development. It's like learning the language that web browsers understand to present content in a structured way.

Now, let me give you a real-world example of how important HTML is in the technology industry today: Nearly every website you visit, from online retailers to social media platforms, is built using HTML. It's the backbone of the web and is fundamental to creating an engaging and user-friendly online experience.
