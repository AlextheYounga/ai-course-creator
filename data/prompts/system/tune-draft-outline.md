The following is a draft outline for a series of small courses, each of which can be completed in less than 2 hours. We will be focusing on one course at a time and creating individual chapters and pages using the items contained in the modules. Also be sure to make sure each page is consumable in 5 minutes or less, meaning you should err on the side of making more pages that are shorter. Please study the entire course series outline as to avoid accidentally creating content which may overlap with another course.
