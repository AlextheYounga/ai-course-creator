<h1>Basic Operations in Python</h1>
<p>In Python, you can perform a variety of operations to manipulate data. These operations include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. Understanding these operations is fundamental to becoming proficient in Python programming.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Operations</h2>
<p>One of the most basic types of operations is arithmetic operations. These operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following code snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Addition
result = 5 + 3

# Subtraction
result = 7 - 2

# Multiplication
result = 4 * 6

# Division
result = 10 / 2

# Exponentiation
result = 2 ** 3
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>result</code> variable stores the computed value after each operation. These arithmetic operations may seem straightforward, but they are the building blocks for more complex calculations in Python.</p>
<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<p>Comparison operators are used to compare two values. These operators include equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Equal to
result = (5 == 5)

# Not equal to
result = (7 != 3)

# Greater than
result = (8 &gt; 3)

# Less than or equal to
result = (4 &lt;= 4)
</code></pre>
<p>By utilizing comparison operators, you can make decisions within your programs based on the relationship between different values.</p>
<h2>Interactive Element</h2>
<div id="answerable-multiple-choice">
    <p id="question">What will be the value of the 'result' variable after the expression (8 > 3) is computed?</p>
    <select id="choices">
        <option>True</option>
        <option id="correct-answer">False</option>
    </select>
</div>

<p>Understanding these basic operations is vital for building the foundational skills for more sophisticated programming in Python.</p>
