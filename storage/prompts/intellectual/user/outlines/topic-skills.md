Prompt: Can you list as many concepts and pieces of factual information as possible that someone would need to go from knowing absolutely nothing to total and complete mastery and knowledge on the topic of {topic}? Make the list as comprehensive as possible. Start with the basic foundational facts then increase in depth and complexity from there. Go as deep and complex as possible, as deep as your knowledge base allows. For example, if I give you "automobiles" as a topic, you should start with the basics of the core parts of an automobile, what they are and how they work, and the history of automobiles before going into more depth on any given concept or subject area. This list will be used to generate courses on {topic}, so make sure you capture every core concept or piece of factual information they might need to attain full knowledge of {topic}. Go into great detail. Begin the list with basic foundational beginner material, and work your way up in depth and level of complexity from there.
