Prompt: Please create material for a page titled "{page_name}". Adopt a casual, conversational, yet professional tone. Use real-world examples and analogies as needed to make the content relatable and practical, but do not use analogies too often; use them only when they will substantially improve student comprehension of the topic at hand. Please, no abbreviating or using bullet points. However, you can use bullet points if and only if you are listing definitions of terms or a list of items. For those situations, you can use a numbered list or bullets. If the course covers historical topics, be sure to include the relevant dates that key events occured on. Avoid all introductory language such as "Hey there!" or otherwise, except if the page is a chapter introduction page. Make sure each page has one interactive element that is either a multiple choice question, a fill in the blank, or a true/false. Ensure each page is no more than 500 words. Make sure the introduction page of each course explains why it is important to learn what the course covers.
