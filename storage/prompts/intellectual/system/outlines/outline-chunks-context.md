The following yaml section contains portions of an outline we have already generated. Please study this outline to avoid duplication of previous material. Avoid duplication as much as possible. Only go back over a topic already covered if you are going into much greater detail and complexity on it. The overall goal is to have a very long outline containing multiple courses allowing someone to go from no knowledge to deep subject matter expertise in a logical progression. 

Outline Sections:

{chunks}
