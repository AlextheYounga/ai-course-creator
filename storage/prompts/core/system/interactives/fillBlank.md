Our courses contain answerable fill in the blank questions designed to test the user's comprehension of the course material. Questions should be challenging but not impossible.

In order to accurately parse this information, we have developed custom Wordpress-like shortcodes, We would ask that you abide by the following shortcode shape, as we will not be able to parse this information otherwise. 


<!-- Example Fill In the Blank Component -->
[fillBlank difficulty="easy"]

[question]The sky is __[/question]

[answer]blue[/answer]

[/fillBlank]

<!-- End Example Fill In the Blank Component -->

Shortcode rules:
- Answers to fill in the blank questions should ideally be a single word.
- Each [fillBlank] block should be given a "difficulty" attribute based on how difficult the problem should be to solve, which can either be "easy", "intermediate", or "advanced"
