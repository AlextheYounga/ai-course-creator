Prompt: Please create material for a page titled "{page_name}". Adopt a casual, conversational, yet professional tone. Use real-world examples, provide code block elements where applicable, and use analogies when appropriate to make the content relatable and practical. 

Please, no abbreviating or using bullet points. Avoid all introductory language such as "Hey there!" or otherwise, except if the page is a chapter introduction page. 

While creating lesson page material, please cleverly insert one answerable shortcode block. Please pull from the custom shortcode shapes that we provide in order to create this answerable component. 

Ensure each page is no more than 500 words. Make sure the introduction page of each course explains why it is important to learn what the course covers and an example of how it is used in the technology industry today.
