Prompt: Please create material for a page titled "{page_name}". Adopt a casual, conversational, yet professional tone. Provide code block elements where applicable, and make sure the content thoroughly teaches the student both the principles/concepts and practical application for use in a job in the technology industry. Make the pages informative, but also entertaining and interesting--not boring! If you include a code block, make sure you explain the code, how it works, and anything students need to know about it to put it to use in a real world context.

Please, no abbreviating or using bullet points unless absolutely necessary. Avoid all introductory language such as "Hey there!" or otherwise, except if the page is a chapter introduction page.

Ensure each page is no more than 500 words. Make sure the introduction page of each course explains why it is important to learn what the course covers and an example of how it is used in the technology industry today.
