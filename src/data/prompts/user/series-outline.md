Using the provided list of required skills for mastery of {topic}, please create an outline for a series of as many small courses as you think are needed that can ideally be consumed in less than two hours. Each course should have at least two modules. Reorganize the items as needed, and try to make each course relatively independent. 

Please return your results in the following format with a <div id="data"> block wrapper so I can easily parse your response:

```html
<div id="data">
  <div class="course">
    <h3>Course Name</h3>
    <section class="module">
      <strong>Module 1 Name</strong>
      <li>A Required Skill</li>
      <li>Another Necessary Skill</li>
      <li>Another Skill, and so on</li>
    </section>
    <section class="module">
      <strong>Module 2 Name</strong>
      <li>A Required Skill</li>
      <li>Another Skill, and so on</li>
    </section>
  </div>
