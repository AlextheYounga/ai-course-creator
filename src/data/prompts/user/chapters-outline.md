Let's generate a chapter outline for the {course_name} course. Using the modules information from our initial course outline, let's dive deeper and create chapters for our eLearning course, and the titles of pages in each chapter. 

Here are the modules we will use to create our chapters. Reorganize these items as needed to create logical course content.

```json
{modules}
```

Please return your results in the following JSON format:
```json
{
    "An Interesting Chapter Name": [
        "Chapter Introduction Page",
        "First Page of Chapter",
        "Second Page of Chapter",
        "Third Page of Chapter, and so on" 
    ]
}
```
