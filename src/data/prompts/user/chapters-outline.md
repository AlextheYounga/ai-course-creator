Let's generate a chapter outline for the {course_name} course using the modules information from the object containing the "courseName": "{course_name}" from our initial course JSON outline. Make sure each chapter concludes with a "practice skill challenge" chapter that includes practice problems testing the user on materials just covered.

Please return your results in the following JSON format:
