Let's generate a chapter outline for the {course_name} course using the modules information from the object containing the "courseName": "{course_name}" from our initial course JSON outline.

Please return your results in the following JSON format:
```json
[
    {
        "chapterName:": "An Interesting Chapter Name",
        "pages": [
            "Chapter Introduction Page",
            "First Page of Chapter",
            "Second Page of Chapter",
            "Third Page of Chapter, and so on"
        ]
    }
]
```
