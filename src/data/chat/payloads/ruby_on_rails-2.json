Rails follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which provides a structured way to develop web applications.\n\n## What is a Web Framework?\n\nBefore we dive deeper into Rails, let's first understand the concept of a web framework. A web framework is a collection of libraries, tools, and conventions that simplifies the process of building web applications. It provides a structure for organizing code and handles common web development tasks, such as routing, database management, and templating.\n\n## Why Use Ruby on Rails?\n\nThere are several reasons why Ruby on Rails has gained immense popularity among web developers:\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Rails follows the principle of \"Convention over Configuration,\" which means it makes assumptions about how your application should be structured, reducing the need for explicit configuration. This simplicity allows developers to focus on building the application logic rather than dealing with boilerplate code.\n\n2. **Rapid Development**: Rails provides a rich set of built-in libraries and tools that handle many common tasks, such as database management, security, and authentication. This accelerates the development process and allows developers to build complete applications faster.\n\n3. **Developer Productivity**: Rails emphasizes writing clean and maintainable code by following best practices and providing clear conventions. The framework provides automated testing, scaffolding, and code generation tools, which enhance developer productivity and collaboration.\n\n4. **Community and Ecosystem**: Ruby on Rails has a vibrant and active community, which means there are a plethora of resources, tutorials, and gems (Ruby libraries) available to help you build robust applications efficiently. The community support makes Rails an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRuby on Rails is an elegant web framework that allows you to build robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. In this lesson, you learned about the concept of a web framework and why Ruby on Rails is widely used in the industry.\n\nIn the next lesson, we will focus on setting up the development environment for Ruby on Rails. We will guide you through the installation process and introduce you to basic terminal commands that you'll need as a Rails developer.","role":"assistant","function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1702916983,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613","object":"chat.completion","system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":452,"prompt_tokens":1094,"total_tokens":1546}}
