It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, commonly referred to as Matz, in the mid-1990s. Ruby provides a high-level, human-friendly syntax that allows developers to write expressive and concise code.\n\n## Ruby Basics\n\nLike any programming language, Ruby has its own set of fundamental concepts that you need to understand before diving into Rails. Let's explore some of these basics:\n\n### Variables, Data Types, and Operators\n\nIn Ruby, variables are used to store values. They are declared by assigning a value to a name. Ruby is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that you don't need to specify the type of a variable explicitly.\n\nRuby supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and symbols. You can perform operations on these data types using operators such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.\n\n### Control Flow and Loops\n\nControl flow structures allow you to conditionally execute blocks of code. Ruby provides if/else statements and case statements for conditional branching. You can also use logical operators like `&&` and `||` to combine conditions.\n\nLoops are used to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. Ruby supports several loop constructs, including `while`, `until`, `for`, and `each`. These loops help you iterate over collections, perform calculations, and manipulate data.\n\n## Ruby Documentation and Resources\n\nAs you progress with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, it's important to have access to documentation and additional resources. The following are some essential references:\n\n- Official Ruby website: [https://www.ruby-lang.org/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)\n- Ruby API documentation: [https://ruby-doc.org/](https://ruby-doc.org/)\n- RubyGems website for exploring gems: [https://rubygems.org/](https://rubygems.org/)\n\nAdditionally, the Ruby community is known for its active and supportive nature. Online forums, such as [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/), can be valuable resources for troubleshooting and getting help from experienced Ruby developers.\n\nRemember, mastering Ruby is the foundation for becoming proficient in Ruby on Rails. In the next lesson, we will introduce you to the world of Rails and understand why it is a popular web framework for building robust applications.","role":"assistant","function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1702916967,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613","object":"chat.completion","system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":490,"prompt_tokens":581,"total_tokens":1071}}
