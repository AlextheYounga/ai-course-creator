In this lesson, we will guide you through generating a new Rails project and help you explore its directory structure.\n\n## Generating a New Rails Application\n\nTo create a new Rails application, open your terminal and execute the following command:\n\n```bash\nrails new myapp\n```\n\nHere, `myapp` is the name you choose for your application. Rails will generate a new project folder with the specified name and set up the necessary files and configurations.\n\n## Exploring the Directory Structure\n\nWhen you generate a new Rails application, it creates a predetermined directory structure that follows Rails conventions. Let's take a look at the important directories and files:\n\n- **app**: This folder contains the core of your application.\n  - **controllers**: Controllers that handle user requests and facilitate data flow.\n  - **models**: Models that represent the data and handle interactions with the database.\n  - **views**: Views that display information to the users.\n  - **assets**: Assets like stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images.\n\n- **config**: Contains configurations for your application.\n  - **database.yml**: Configuration file for the database connection.\n  - **routes.rb**: Defines the routes that map URLs to controller actions.\n\n- **db**: Contains database-related files, such as migrations and the schema file.\n\n- **Gemfile**: Specifies the gems (Ruby libraries) that your application depends on.\n\n- **public**: Contains static files accessible directly by the users, such as error pages.\n\n- **test**: Folder for test files, including unit tests and functional tests.\n\n- **README.md**: A markdown file that typically provides instructions and information about the project.\n\nThis is just a high-level overview of the directory structure. As you progress with Rails development, you'll become more familiar with each directory and its purpose.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this lesson, you generated a new Rails application using the `rails new` command and explored the directory structure of a Rails project. Understanding the organization of files and folders is crucial for efficient development and maintaining a well-structured application.\n\nIn the next lesson, we will dive into working with models and learn how to create database models using Rails' powerful ORM, ActiveRecord.","role":"assistant","function_call":null,"tool_calls":null}}],"created":1702917033,"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613","object":"chat.completion","system_fingerprint":null,"usage":{"completion_tokens":470,"prompt_tokens":2717,"total_tokens":3187}}
