# Lesson 4: Understanding MVC Architecture

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development. In this lesson, we will delve into the MVC architecture and understand how Ruby on Rails utilizes this pattern to structure web applications.

## What is MVC?

MVC separates an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages the data, interacts with the database, and performs validations and calculations. In Rails, models are implemented using ActiveRecord and encapsulate the data and behavior of the application.

- **View**: The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It defines the user interface and handles the rendering of information. In Rails, views are typically written using ERB (Embedded Ruby) templating language, which allows you to embed Ruby code within HTML.

- **Controller**: The controller receives user requests, processes them, and interacts with the model and view. It handles the logic behind the scenes and determines which model data to retrieve, how to manipulate it, and which view to render. Controllers in Rails are responsible for defining actions that respond to specific URLs.

## How Rails Implements MVC

In Ruby on Rails, the MVC pattern is deeply ingrained in the framework's design. Let's take a closer look at how Rails implements each component:

- **Model**: Rails utilizes ActiveRecord, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to create and manage models. ActiveRecord provides an abstraction layer that makes it easier to work with databases by mapping database tables to Ruby objects. With ActiveRecord, you can define model attributes, validations, associations, and database interactions effortlessly.

- **View**: Rails employs the ERB templating system to generate dynamic content for the views. ERB allows you to embed Ruby code within HTML, enabling you to dynamically present model data to the user. With ERB, you can include conditionals, loops, and helper methods to generate HTML that adapts to the application's state and user input.

- **Controller**: Rails controllers are responsible for handling user requests and orchestrating the flow of data between models and views. Controllers define actions that map to specific URLs, and these actions manipulate the model data and render the appropriate views. Controllers also handle request parameters, session management, and authentication.

## Conclusion

Understanding and embracing the Model-View-Controller architecture is crucial for building scalable and maintainable web applications with Ruby on Rails. In this lesson, you learned the core concepts of MVC and how Rails implements this architectural pattern.

In the next lesson, we will dive into hands-on activities by creating your first Rails application. You'll get the opportunity to generate a new Rails project and explore the directory structure to understand how Rails organizes files and folders.
