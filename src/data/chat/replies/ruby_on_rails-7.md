# Lesson 7: Implementing Views

Views are responsible for presenting data to the users in a Ruby on Rails application. In this lesson, we will explore Rails' view templating system, working with layouts and partials, and utilizing view helpers to enhance the user interface.

## Rails View Templating System

Rails uses the ERB (Embedded Ruby) templating system to generate dynamic content for the views. ERB allows you to embed Ruby code within HTML, enabling you to present model data and perform logic within your views.

To create a view for a specific action in a controller, follow this naming convention: `<action_name>.html.erb`. For example, if you have a `show` action in your `UsersController`, you would create a `show.html.erb` file.

## Layouts and Partials

Layouts define the overall structure of your application's pages. They typically contain common elements like headers, footers, and navigation menus. Rails allows you to define layouts to encapsulate these elements and provide a consistent look and feel across multiple views.

Partials are reusable view components that can be rendered within other views or layouts. They are helpful when you have common sections of HTML that need to be shared across different views. To create a partial, prefix the filename with an underscore (e.g., `_header.html.erb`).

## View Helpers

View helpers provide utility methods that you can use within your views to generate HTML, format data, and perform other view-related tasks. Rails provides a rich set of built-in view helpers that simplify common tasks, such as rendering forms, generating URLs,
